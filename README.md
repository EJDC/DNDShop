## Features

- Checkout page to see totals, input character details, select Delivery/Payment options and amend selections.
- Payment page to see order summary, input payment information etc.
- Confirmation page with order and payment summary.

## Learning Points

I worked on this app for my final project for Harvards' CS50x course, with an aim to revise my Typescript/React skills learned last year at Codeclan.

- Creating multi-component 'shop' style web application with React.
- Writing more accessible HTML using accessibilty tools such as Wave.
- Making multiple API Requests to load JSON data which can be manipulated in the application.
- CSS using Tailwind.
- Deploying to github pages.
## Version

The demo linked above is currently version 1.0 of the project at the moment and is entirely frontend. In future, I'd like to improve the initial selection page to improve useability add some more additional features (eg a backend to record orders, add user accounts etc) to enhance the app and continue to develop my skills.
## Installation

Install DNDShop locally with npm

```bash
  npm install DNDShop
  cd DNDShop
